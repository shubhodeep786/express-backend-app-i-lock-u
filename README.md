# Express Server Project

This project is an Express server with various configurations and utilities.

## File Structure

- `config/`: Configuration files
- `migrations/`: Database migration scripts
- `models/`: Data models
- `middleware/`: Custom middleware functions
- `seeders/`: Database seeding scripts
- `node_modules/`: Project dependencies (not tracked in version control)
- `package.json`: Project metadata and dependencies
- `package-lock.json`: Locked versions of dependencies
- `swagger.js`: Swagger/OpenAPI configuration
- `token.js`: Token generation and validation utilities
- `index.js`: Main server entry point
- `sync.js`: Database synchronization script
- `test-connection.js`: Database connection test script

## File Usage

### config/
Contains configuration files for the application, such as database settings, environment variables, etc.

### migrations/
Stores database migration scripts for version control of your database schema.

### models/
Defines data models used in the application, typically for ORM (Object-Relational Mapping).

### middleware/
Custom middleware functions to process requests before they reach the route handlers.

### seeders/
Scripts to populate the database with initial or test data.

### package.json
Defines project dependencies and scripts. Use this file to add new dependencies or scripts.

### swagger.js
Configures Swagger/OpenAPI for API documentation. Modify this file to update API documentation.

### token.js
Handles token generation and validation for authentication purposes.

### index.js
The main entry point for the Express server. This file sets up the server and defines routes.

### sync.js
Used to synchronize the database schema with the defined models.

### test-connection.js
A utility script to test the database connection.

## Running the Server in Development Mode

To run the Express server in development mode, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have Node.js installed on your system.

2. Install project dependencies:

3. Set up your environment variables (if required) in a `.env` file.

4. Run the server in development mode:

This command will start your server in development mode. Make sure your `package.json` file has the correct "start" script. It should look something like this:
```json
"scripts": {
  "start": "node index.js"
}

5. To test the database connection, run:

node test-connection.js

6. To sync the database (be cautious in production), run:

node sync.js

Remember to update this README as your project evolves, adding more detailed instructions or explanations as needed.

This revision reflects that `npm start` is the command to start the server in development mode, while also providing information about setting up a separate dev script with nodemon if auto-reloading is desired. Is there anything else you'd like me to modify or explain about the README?
